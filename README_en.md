# Patchy Core – DNS-Agnostic Init Engine for Secure Linux Services

Patchy Core is a developer-centric init engine and service framework designed for DNS-independent, systemd-free environments.  
Built for WSL2 + Debian setups, it prioritizes auditability, modularity, and secure service orchestration.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Replace systemd with a minimal, auditable init engine
- Enable DNS-agnostic service management for secure infrastructure
- Provide reproducible service logic for CLI-based Linux environments
- Support infrastructure reform through developer-level tooling

This is not a distribution, not a tutorial, and not a community init system.  
It is a technical stance: structure over compatibility, audit over abstraction.

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

- Custom init engine (no systemd)
- DNS-independent service logic
- Modular component architecture
- Designed for WSL2 + Debian
- CLI-only configuration and traceable logs

## 📚 Documentation

Patchy Core does not include installers or onboarding guides.  
Each component is documented for reproducibility and auditability.  
Intended for developers who understand service orchestration at the system level.
